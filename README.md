# muserstory

The project focuses on creating a command line interface (CLI) tool that enables users to efficiently manage and organize their user stories. Users can categorize these stories to enhance organization and enable logical grouping, making it easier to track various features and requirements. By implementing a flag for specifying a markdown file, users will have the ability to store their categorized user stories in a structured format.

Additionally, the tool allows users to receive individual proposals for user stories sequentially in the CLI. They can assess each proposal and decide whether to store it based on a simple response of 'y' or 'n'. This interactive approach provides users with control over what gets included in their final documentation.

Furthermore, upon submitting all categorized user stories, users can expect to receive a comprehensive summary that gives them an overview of all features. This capability offers not only practical organization but also enhances the overall project management experience.

In the future, the project could evolve into a more sophisticated platform, incorporating collaborative features for teams, integration with project management systems, and advanced analytics on user story trends and priorities. There is also potential to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to complement the CLI, making the tool more accessible to a wider range of users who may prefer visual interaction over command line operations.
